## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

For production-like environment testing, use:

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

For production build with additional optimizations:

```bash
ng build --configuration production
```

## Deployment

The application can be deployed to various hosting platforms. For optimal SEO performance, we recommend:

1. Using a CDN for static assets
2. Implementing proper caching strategies
3. Setting up SSL certificates
4. Configuring proper redirects and canonical URLs
